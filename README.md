# Inno Day

## How to run
- `npm install`
- `node image-capture.js`

This script is a WIP.

Is currently a place holder for our other code.

## What does this script do?
Calls our web cam script to capture images every 5 seconds.

Makes our request to our Tensorflow application to decide whether it is mail or and ad.

Send that value to our python script which will tell our servo what to do.
